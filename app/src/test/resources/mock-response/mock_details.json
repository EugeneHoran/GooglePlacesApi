They saw me enter and check in in a wedding dress, carrying a suitcase and didn't even offer to help us to our room, or with our baggage behind us!\n\nOur event managers were great at dealing with them, but the hotel staff themselves were extremely standoffish with us. Giving at least 3 stars because the facilities are nice.\n\nDidn't have hot water in our room and the shower was really odd, but given the helpful nature of the staff, there was really no point in getting help. We were meant to have an executive breakfast but they gave us a basic one. Such apathy on their part!",

The Tower suite and the Bridge suite. I can't remember which was which, but the presentation facility was excellent with decent AV capabilities. For me though, whilst the space outside the presentation area is good, with stunning views of Tower Bridge and the Shard, it wasn't great for what the organisers of the event were trying to use it for. Not a reflection on the hotel by the way. Catering was excellent (a beef dish to die for and really good cookies in the afternoon). Staff were pleasant and helpful. I'm looking forward to when I need to go there for the next event.",
